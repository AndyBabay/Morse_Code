One of the most well known signals sent during distress is ". . . - - - . . ." which can be translated as SOS in Morse code.

My project hopes to mirror what communication was like in the early 1800s through a program that does conversion from Morse code to English.

What seperates this program from a conventional one is the fact that many important programming paradigms were considered during the proccess of this project
